# HistoryHider
This is a Chrome extension I made that lets you erase your browsing data with a click of a button.
I created this extension to get a basic understanding of how browser extensions work, and how they are made. I was also tired of constantly going to my history page, pressing "Clear browsing data," and selecting the data I wanted to erase.

How this extension works: 
  1) Install the extension by dragging the .crx file into chrome://extensions
  2) When you want to erase your browsing data, simply press the eye icon with a slash mark thru it (next to all other extension icons)
  3) Wait for the alert that says "Your history has been cleared!"

Enjoy!
